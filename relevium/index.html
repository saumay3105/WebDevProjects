                Let's jaunt through the untrodden woods, desolate shores, 
                abandoned individuals, intruded society to spawn the ideas,
                and change the mindset of people, choosing YOU over THE FUTURE...

                    We envision a world in which the most vulnerable people will
                    have the power to speak for themselves. A world where the most
                    destitute of children to the richest are the ones who reshape 
                    the world. The crux of our work lies in our ability to “nourish
                    and assist”, whether it be a small seedling or a child studying
                    under the lamp. The whole essence of team Relevium lies in the
                    English translation of our venture, ”Relief”.
